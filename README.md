# Project Io

This project is an IntelliJ plugin which allows multiple users to edit the same project. This colaborative development is done in real-time with all updates showing on each users IDE.

For a list of planned features, [check our project's backlog here](https://github.com/JackOBrien/Concurrent-Editor/wiki/Backlog "Project Io Backlog").
